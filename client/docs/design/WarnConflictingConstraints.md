## Warn user if conflicting constraints are established

There really needs to be a feature that warns a user attempting to establish conflicting constraints.
For example:   

 -  change force min 1000   
 -  change force max 900   
   
Note:  At the conclusion of a search with conflicting constraints, it is likely that **both** max and min constraints will be violated and highlighted.
