**Notes:**  
 This file and the startup file (initialState) contain the only units dependence within ODOP:Spring. 
 If the startup file is altered consistent with changes to this file, 
 ODOP:Spring can be made to operate in any unit system.

 Modulus and stress values are multiplied by 1000 during the read process.

 %_TENSILE_ENDUR values have been limited at %_TENSILE_STAT (pte1) values.
 This affects primarily the non-ferrous shot peened entries.
 Shot peened %_TENSILE_BEND values are zero because extension springs are not typically peened.  

 Catalog files may be dependent on this file. 
 Do not add or delete entries in this file without checking for corresponding changes to the catalog file(s).  

 See Help lookup Prop_Calc_Method for details on calculation of material properties. 
 Prop_Calc_Method = 1 recalculates tensile strength for every new value of Wire_Dia.  Not so with Prop_Calc_Method 2 and 3. 
 Prop_Calc_Method = 3 does not use any of the percent tensile values. 
 Switching from Prop_Calc_Method 1 to 2 or 3, retains the existing values. 
 Switching from Prop_Calc_Method 2 or 3 to 1 resets to table values. 
 In most cases, it is possible examine the Calculation Inputs to see the values in this table appear in the user interface.
 Examine the appropriate spring type init.js file to better understand how the values in this table feed into the design equations.
