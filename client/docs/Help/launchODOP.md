# Launching the Program   

As noted in the [requirements](/docs/About/requirements.html) page, 
it is not necessary to load any software on your computer in order to run the 
ODOP software. 
Only an Internet connection and recent web browser are necessary.

While it is possible to use the ODOP software from a mobile device,
establishing initial impressions with a full-size monitor, keyboard and mouse
is recommended.   

Where a wide-screen monitor is in use, 
it should be possible to view both the program and on-line Help entries 
simultaneously in separate, non-overlapping windows.
See: [Utilizing on-line Help with a widescreen monitor](wideScreen.html) for additional details. 
If a wide-screen monitor is not available, 
you can operate with this Help content in one
browser tab while the ODOP app is in another browser tab.
This approach will permit rapid switching from this Help content in order
to view the corresponding part of the program user interface. 

Spring design users are expected to launch ODOP:Spring from the 
[SpringDesignSoftware.org](https://www.springdesignsoftware.org/) website.  

In order to start the ODOP software in **this browser window** (or tab), 
follow this link:   

[Launch ODOP](https://odop.springdesignsoftware.org) 
  
Alternatively, copy this address (URL):   

**https://odop.springdesignsoftware.org**

and paste it into the address field of a different browser window (or tab).   
  
<!---
Depending on current web hosting provisions, 
there may be a delay of approximately 20 seconds the first time that the software is launched
within any specific 30 minute period.

While a user account is not required to access the ODOP software,
an account with associated username and password is necessary to save designs into 
the cloud-based ODOP "Design Library".
See: [User Accounts](/docs/About/userAccounts.html) for details on
how to obtain an account.
