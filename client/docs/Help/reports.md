# Reports

ODOP has the capability to present different "views" of the same design. 
The spring design types each provide multiple reports of design type specific information 
in a compact format and accessed through the View menu.
The Piston-Cylinder and Rectangular Solid design types do not provide any reports.

&nbsp;

The reports should be thought of as just another "view" providing 
somewhat different information about the same design. 
Any change made on the main page will immediately be reflected
in each of the reports.

Depending on the capabilities of the user's web browser,
it should be possible to print the individual report pages or save 
into .PDF format.
For additional information, refer to [printing tips](htt.html#printing) 
and documentation on your browser's print function.
