## Overview  
Most ODOP features work without an account.
A free account is required to save designs to the cloud-based (on-line) 
[ODOP Design Library](/docs/Help/terminology.html#designLib) and keep them private. 
Accounts use an email address and password for secure access.  

Having an account also allows you to [Personalize System-Provided Designs](userAccounts.html#defaultdesigns).

## Sign up  
You can create a free private account in two ways:  

**Option 1 – Self‑Service Registration** from within the app:  
1. [launch the ODOP app](/docs/Help/launchODOP.html) from the SpringDesignSoftware.org home page, 
Getting Started page or any spring type page.  
1. Push the "**Sign In...**" button at the left of the menu bar.  
1. Use the "**Sign up**" feature at the lower right of the Sign In page.  
1. Follow the prompts and confirm your account via the activation email. Your account is ready immediately.  

**Option 2 – Email Request**  
Send a message to **Info@SpringDesignSoftware.org** to request an account. 
You will receive a reply message (welcome letter) with further instructions. 
This alternative contains one step that is not automated, 
so expect a delay of hours to a day or so. 
The welcome letter includes instructions on how to establish a password and later  
change it.

## Session Duration  
Your session remains active as long as:
 - The browser browser window (tab) running the app stays open
 - Your Internet connection is maintained.  

After multiple hours of inactivity, a browser refresh will require you to sign in again.  

**Important:**  
Save your work frequently. Closing the browser tab or window may lose any unsaved designs.

 [File : Save As or File : Save](/docs/Help/htt.html#fileSaveAndSaveAs).

 - Your personalized version will replace the system-provided design and will **not** be marked **[ReadOnly]**.  

To restore the original system-provided design, delete your customized version.

## Other Account Maintenance
Currently, you cannot use self-service to: 
 - delete your account  
 - change your email address  
 - change your first name or last name
 
Please [Contact Us](/docs/About/ContactUs.html) for assistance with these changes.  

Where relatively few designs are involved, 
there is an approach to moving to a new email address that can be accomplished without assistance.  
1. When signed in to the original account, use the [Download All](/docs/Help/menus.html#FileDownloadAll) 
feature to export all designs to a .ZIP file in local storage.  
1. Expand the .ZIP file.  
1. Create a new account with the new email address.  
1. When signed in to the new account, import each design.  
1. Sign in to the old account and delete all designs.
