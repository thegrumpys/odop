## Overview  
A user account is **not** required to operate most features of the software. 
In order to save designs into the cloud-based (on-line) [ODOP Design Library](/docs/Help/terminology.html#designLib), 
it is necessary to establish a user account with associated username (email address) and password 
so as to keep those designs private.

## Sign up  
You can sign up for a private account within the app. 
Launch the ODOP software from the SpringDesignSoftware.org home page, 
Getting Started page or any of the three spring type pages. 
To establish a free private account, 
push the "**Sign In...**" button at the left of the menu bar and then 
use the "**Sign up**" (Self-Service Registration) feature at the lower right of the Sign In page. 
After responding to an activation email message, 
your account will be ready for immediate sign-in.  

Alternatively, send a request to: **Info@SpringDesignSoftware.org**. 
You will receive a reply message (welcome letter) with instructions on how to complete creating your account. 
This alternative contains one step that is not automated, 
so expect a delay of hours to a day or so. 
The welcome letter includes instructions on how to establish a password and if desired, 
change it in the future.  

See [Data Retention Policy](Legal/dataRetentionPolicy.html) for long-term data storage policies.

## User Name  
An account username must be in the form of an email address. 
As noted in our [Privacy Notice](Legal/PrivacyStatement.html), 
your personal information will be secure and not abused. 
If you have any remaining concerns on this point, 
using an email account different than your primary email account is a reasonable approach.

## Password Reset  
To change a password or recover from a lost password after account creation is complete: 
 - [launch the ODOP:Spring app](/docs/Help/launchODOP.html) 
 - select the "**Sign In...**" button at the left of the menu bar 
 - select "**Forgot password?**" on the Sign In page 
 - provide your email address on the "**Reset Password**" page and click "**Reset via email**"
 - Check for an email message. If not found, be sure to check your spam/junk mail folder.  
 - **Note:** The validation email message expires after 24 hours.

   
See [Default Designs](/docs/Help/defaultDesigns.html) for information on how a private design 
can be used to personalize system provided default designs. 

See [Restrictions](Legal/Restrictions.html) for long term data storage policies 
in both public and private accounts. 

The **File : Export** menu item allows design data to be preserved in local storage. 
For details, see: [Save, Save As, Import and Export](/docs/Help/htt.html#fileSaveAndSaveAs). 
 
Once signed in, your user session will remain active for as long as the browser window (tab) 
associated with the app exists and your Internet connection is maintained. 
You should save frequently as once the browser window or tab is closed, 
any unsaved design in progress may be lost. 
For more information on this point, see: [AutoSave](/docs/Help/autoSave.html). 

## Troubleshooting sign in issues 
- Be sure to enter your complete email address in the "Email" field of the Sign In page.
