## Overview  
You can use most ODOP features without creating an account. 
However, to save designs into the cloud-based (on-line) [ODOP Design Library](/docs/Help/terminology.html#designLib), 
and keep them private, it is necessary to establish a user account with associated email address and password.  

In addition, having an account also allows you to [Personalize Default Designs](userAccounts.html#defaultdesigns).

## Sign up  
You can create a free private account directly within the app:  
1. [launch the ODOP app](/docs/Help/launchODOP.html) from the SpringDesignSoftware.org home page, 
Getting Started page or any spring type page. 
1. Push the "**Sign In...**" button at the left of the menu bar.  
1. Use the "**Sign up**" (Self-Service Registration) feature at the lower right of the Sign In page.  
1. Follow the prompts and confirm your account via the activation email.
1. Once confirmed, you can sign in immediately.  

Alternative sign-up method:  
Send a message to **Info@SpringDesignSoftware.org** to request an account. 
You will receive a reply message (welcome letter) with further instructions. 
This alternative contains one step that is not automated, 
so expect a delay of hours to a day or so. 
The welcome letter includes instructions on how to establish a password and later  
change it.  

Tip: Review the [Data Retention Policy](Legal/dataRetentionPolicy.html) for long-term data storage.

As noted in our [Privacy Notice](Legal/PrivacyStatement.html), 
your personal information is secure and will not be misused.

## Session Duration  
Your session remains active as long as:
 - The browser browser window (tab) running the app stays open
 - Your Internet connection is maintained.  

After multiple hours of inactivity, a browser refresh will require a new login.  

**Important:**  
Save your work frequently. Closing the browser tab or window may lose any unsaved designs.

## Saving and Restoring Designs  
With an ODOP account, you can:
 - Save designs into the [ODOP Design Library](/docs/Help/terminology.html#designLib) using
 [File : Save As or File : Save](/docs/Help/htt.html#fileSaveAndSaveAs). 
 - Access saved designs with [File : Open](/docs/Help/menus.html#FileOpen).  
 
Designs saved while signed in are private and can only be accessed when signed in 
with the account (email address and current password) that created them.

 - [File : Import](/docs/Help/menus.html#FileImport)

## Personalize Default Designs  
You can customize [Default Designs](/docs/Help/defaultDesigns.html) 
by by saving over them with the same name. 
 - System default designs are marked **[ReadOnly]**.  
 - Your personalized version will replace the system default and will not be marked **[ReadOnly]**.  

Deleting the customized default design will restore access to the system default design of that name.  

**Note:**  
Customized designs are available only when signed in. 
Designs that you see before sign in are the system default.  

**Basic Example:**  
Open the system design "Startup_Metric", make changes, 
and use **File : Save** to save it with the name "Startup_Metric". 
Once signed in, 
your customized version will now load when "Startup_Metric" is accessed by **File : Open**  

**Advanced Example:**  
While the following example may provide a useful shortcut for experienced users,
it may also provide an opportunity for unexpected behavior and confusion for less experienced users. 
See [Default Designs](/docs/Help/defaultDesigns.html) for additional insights.  

Open the system design "Startup_Metric", make changes, 
and use **File : Save As** to save it with the name "Startup". 
Once signed in, 
your customized metric version will now load when "Startup" is accessed by **File : Open**.
