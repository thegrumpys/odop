## Overview  
A user account is **not** required to operate most features of the software. 
In order to save designs into the cloud-based (on-line) [ODOP Design Library](/docs/Help/terminology.html#designLib), 
it is necessary to establish a user account with associated email address and password 
so as to keep those designs private.

## Sign up  
You can sign up for a private account within the app. 
[launch the ODOP app](/docs/Help/launchODOP.html) from the SpringDesignSoftware.org home page, 
Getting Started page or any of the three spring type pages. 
To establish a free private account, 
push the "**Sign In...**" button at the left of the menu bar and then 
use the "**Sign up**" (Self-Service Registration) feature at the lower right of the Sign In page. 
After responding to an activation email message, 
your account will be ready for immediate sign-in.  

Alternatively, send a request to: **Info@SpringDesignSoftware.org**. 
You will receive a reply message (welcome letter) with instructions on how to complete creating your account. 
This alternative contains one step that is not automated, 
so expect a delay of hours to a day or so. 
The welcome letter includes instructions on how to establish a password and if desired, 
change it in the future.  

See the [Data Retention Policy](Legal/dataRetentionPolicy.html) for long-term data storage policies.

## User Name  
An account username must be in the form of an email address. 
As noted in our [Privacy Notice](Legal/PrivacyStatement.html), 
your personal information will be secure and not abused. 
If you have any remaining concerns on this point, 
using an email account different than your primary email account is a reasonable approach.

___

## Session Duration  
Once signed in, your user session will remain active for as long as the browser window (tab) 
associated with the app exists and your Internet connection is maintained. 
After multiple hours of inactivity, a browser refresh will require a new login.  

You should save frequently as once the browser window or tab is closed, 
any unsaved design in progress may be lost.

## Saving Designs  
Once an ODOP Account is established, it is possible to use the 
[File : Save As and File : Save](/docs/Help/htt.html#fileSaveAndSaveAs) 
menu items to save designs into the 
[ODOP Design Library](/docs/Help/terminology.html#designLib).

Similarly, the [File : Export](/docs/Help/menus.html#FileExport) menu item allows 
design data to be preserved in the user's local file system.

## Personalize Default Designs  
It is possible to [Personalize Default Designs](/docs/Help/defaultDesigns.html). 
Specifically, by saving "on top of" a system design (marked "[ReadOnly]"), 
a private design can take the place of system provided default designs.
