## Information Collection, Use, and Sharing   
We are the sole owners of the information collected on this site. 
We only have access to/collect information that you voluntarily give us via email or other direct contact from you. 
We will not sell or rent this information to anyone.
We will use your information to respond to you, regarding the reason you contacted us. 
We will not share your information with any third party outside of our organization, other than as necessary to fulfill your request, e.g. to ship an order.
Unless you ask us not to, we may contact you via email in the future to tell you about new products or services, or changes to this privacy policy.

## Security   
Where possible, we avoid collecting sensitive information (such as credit card data). 
We take precautions to protect any information we do collect. 
If you do submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and offline.
You can verify this by looking for a lock icon in the address bar and looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the Web page.
While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. 
Only personnel who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. 
The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.

## Links   
This website contains links to other sites. 
Please be aware that we are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of such other sites. 
We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of any other site that might collect personally identifiable information.   

## Cookies   
A "cookie" is a piece of data stored on a site visitor's local storage to help improve the visitors access to that site and identify repeat visitors. 
For instance, by using a cookie to identify you, you would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time and effort. 
Cookies can also enable a site to track and target the interests of its users to enhance the experience on the site. 

The springdesignsoftware.org website does not use cookies. 
However, some of our business partners 
(for example: Heroku, JawsDB, GitHub Pages, Gartner / Capterra and Google Analytics) 
may use cookies related to our site.
We have no access to or control over these cookies.   

The ODOP AutoSave feature utilizes a technology similar to cookies in order to preserve and recover design data 
in various situations where it might otherwise be lost.
This AutoSave feature is not used for user tracking.

## IP Address   
We may collect user IP address information associated with access to our database (a.k.a. the ODOP Design Library) 
for the purpose of measuring usage of the system.
Google Analytics is currently under evaluation as an alternative means to measuring usage of the system
that does not reveal IP address information.  

Note that use of VPN (Virtual Private Network) technology hides the true IP address and physical location of the user.
