                    The following example illustrates the use of ODOP:Spring in
                    the design of a compression spring from original specifications.

                    As with the other tutorial and demo sessions,
                    this session needs to start from a known state.
                    So, if you have entered any work of value that is not yet saved,
                    use the <b>File : Save</b> menu item to save your work before continuing.
                    Moving to the next page will establish the necessary initialState
                    for the ODOP <b>Compression Spring</b> design type.

                    The initial conditions expected by this demo session are now established.
                    Before we make additional changes, let's review the problem statement:<br />
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Design a compression spring such that the following conditions are met:<br />
                    <br />
                    material = oil tempered MB wire<br />
                    ends     = closed & ground<br />
                    near infinite cycle life<br />
                    outside diameter: anything less than 1.250 inches<br />
                    solid height:     anything less than 1.300 inches<br />
                    <br />
                    The spring will cycle over a 0.65 inch stroke and must produce:<br />
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; an initial load of 30 pounds and<br />
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; a  final   load of 60 pounds<br />
                    <br />
                    Determine free length, wire diameter and number of coils.
                    Use a standard wire size.
                    Determine if a similar spring is available in the catalog.

                    In general, the easiest way to begin is to modify an existing design.
                    This demo session will modify this design until it meets the requirements
                    of the current design problem.
                    The following sequence of pages will illustrate this process.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Two diagrams follow.
                    The first provides a high level overview of the ODOP design process or sequence.
                    The second illustrates the names of ODOP:Spring variables
                    in the context of a force-deflection diagram.

                    Now that we have expressed what we want the design to accomplish,
                    we will ask the Search algorithm (<b>Action : Search</b> menu) for a solution.
                    Specifically, Search will attempt to find values of the free Independent Variables
                    that cause the newly established Constraints and FIXes to be satisfied.

                    If the program can find a solution that fully satisfies all the constraints,
                    it will display "<b>STRICTLY FEASIBLE</b>" in the Result section (immediately below these words).
                    If a satisfactory solution is found, but one or more constraints remain violated by a
                    trivial amount, the program will display "<b>FEASIBLE</b>" in the Result section.
                    If the search process is unable to find a solution, the red "<b>NOT FEASIBLE</b>" will persist.

                    As a general rule, in the first approach to a new problem,
                    let the calculations use an arbitrary (non-standard) wire diameter.
                    As a last step, select a standard wire diameter.
                    Then with Wire_Dia in FIXed status, execute a search to make any necessary
                    adjustments in the remaining free Independent Variables.

                    Now that there has been a slight change in wire diameter, another search

                    This is a good time to think about saving the design for potential access in the future.
                    Use the <b>File : Save As...</b> menu item to save the design into the Design Library.
                    The ODOP Design Library is "cloud", not local, storage.
                    Alternatively, the <b>File : Export</b> menu item saves to your local Downloads folder.
                    Also, it should be possibile to use the print features of the browser to
                    send one or more of the Reports to a local printer or perhaps save to a .PDF file.
                    Your browser documentation should provide more details about printing.

                    Selecting a catalog entry will replace the current design.
                    So again, if this were a real design situation as opposed to a demo session,

                    then evaluate it.
                    Again, the demo session needs your participation on

                    Pressing the "Select" button causes the
