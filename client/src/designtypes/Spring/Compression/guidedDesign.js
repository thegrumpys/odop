                    <p>
                    Welcome to the "Guided Design" tutorial session.
                    This session is appropriate for a situation where you are creating a
                    design from the original problem specification as opposed to validating
                    an existing or hypothetical design.
                    This session is independent of the spring type (compression, extension or torsion)
                    and does not make any changes to the existing design.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Before working through this session,
                    take the opportunity to view some of the other,
                    more introductory, tutorial and demo sessions.
                    This session is different than other sessions in that it
                    provides only high-level guidance for a spring design workflow and
                    does not actually execute any design changes.
                    You supply numbers and menu selections while following step-by-step instructions
                    and explanations provided to guide you through the design process.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    This approach is possible because the sessions are "live" and not
                    a simple playback of a previous recording.
                    The main and report pages have simply been displaced downward by the text in
                    this light green section.
                    All the menus and other inputs to the program remain available and active.
                    With only a bit of coaching provided by this session,
                    you are expected to enter values and execute menu selections appropriate to the
                    design problem at hand.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Where the other tutorial and demo sessions start by imposing a known
                    starting design (a.k.a. initialState),
                    this session allows the previously existing design to be carried forward.
                    While you can use either U.S. customary or metric units in this session,
                    currently available spring catalogs use U.S. units.
                    It is helpful if the design brought into this session
                    is a plausible spring so as to provide a reasonable starting point
                    for the operations to come later.
                    For example, a value of zero for any of the spring dimensions can
                    create an unneccessary challenge in getting the search algorithm started.
                    </p>

                    One of the points of this session is to illustrate that use of the
                    File : Save As... feature provides an opportunity to easily go back to a
                    previous point in the design process.
                    Before saving a design it is a good practice to use the File : Properties... menu
                    to add notes into the Comment field.
                    Also, establishing a naming scheme with a common prefix like "ProjectX"
                    is helpful in having a presentation with related designs clustered together.
                    <br /><br />
                    So, if you wish to preserve your existing design,
                    <br />
                    <b> use the File : Save As... menu now.</b>

                    The next screen displays a diagram illustrating the major steps that this session
                    guides you through.
                    The diagram is intended only as a "big picture" conceptual starting point.
                    The rest of the session provides considerably more detail.

                    This is the time to express your objectives (goals, requirements) for the design at hand
                    in terms of minimum and maximum constraints and Fixes.
                    More information about constraints and Fix is available in the
                    <a href="/docs/Help/terminology.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Terminology </a>
                    section of the on-line Help.

                    For the moment, leave wire diameter (Wire_Dia) free.
                    This allows the search to manipulate wire diameter as necessary to achieve those goals.
                    Selecting an available wire size happens later in the session.

                    <p>
                    Notice that several constraints are established in the default Startup design.
                    For example, you should see established constraints on quantities like:

                    These constraints are helpful in guiding the search to deliver a good spring design.
                    Without similar constraints, the search can "cheat", producing a result that is
                    mathematically possible but not particularly helpful in terms of a usable spring design.
                    You should feel free to experiment with different values for these constraint levels.

                    If the "Feasibility:" result of the search is "NOT FEASIBLE",
                    consider the possibility that some aspect of the design is over-specified.
                    More information on such a possibility is provided in this entry on the on-line help:
                    <a href="/docs/Help/designSituations.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Design situations: under-specified, properly specified, over-specified </a>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Given that the design is properly specified but just not achievable within the available
                    space and material properties
                    it is likely necessary to accept compromise and adjust the goals for the design
                    as expressed in terms of Fixes and constraint levels.
                    This can be done manually.
                    Also, the
                    &nbsp;<a href="/docs/Help/trade.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trade feature</a>&nbsp;
                    can be used to gain a better understanding of exactly how much your
                    constraints need to be adjusted in order to find the "nearest" feasible design.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    If the "Feasibility:" result of the search is "STRICTLY FEASIBLE" or "FEASIBLE",
                    then the Seek feature can be used to provide an optimized result.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    This is a good time to take a close look at existing values.
                    Scroll down to see everything.
                    The Reports (available on the View menu) offer additional information in a spring design specific format.
                    Again, if you want to preserve the option to easily return to this state of the design,
                    update the Comment field and use the File : Save As... menu.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    While it really doesn't make a lot of difference,
                    if you are still viewing a Report,
                    you may want to switch back to a main page (Advanced or Calculator View) before using the "Next" button to proceed.

                    The Seek feature can find the constrained extreme of any independent or dependent variable
                    that is not in Fixed status.
                    For compression springs, the most likely candidates are:
                    min Weight, max Cycle_Life, min OD_Free, min L_Solid (solid height), min Rate and max Stroke.
                    </p>

                    </p>

                    <p>
                    When examining the results of Seek, you may notice that multiple constraints are
                    violated by a small amount.
                    In this situation
                    the design is classified as "MARGINALLY FEASIBLE" or even "NOT FEASIBLE".
                    This is normal.
                    The solution algorithm is finding a balance between the rewards and penalties of
                    violating those constraints
                    </p>

                    <p>

                    Take a moment to review the results.
                    Is this a reasonable design that meets the original objectives ? &nbsp;
                    If not, try adjusting constraint levels and repeating Search and Seek.

                    The next step gets into selecting a standard wire size.
                    But first this design needs to be saved in order to keep it
                    available for re-use in a few more steps.
                    Invoke the File : Properties menu to update the Comment field
                    and invoke the File : Save As... menu to
                    <br /><br />
                    <b>Save the current design with a name like "ProjectX_Baseline"</b>.

                    Note that this operation leaves Wire_Dia in Fixed status.
                    Even a small change in wire diameter has likely caused constraints to be violated.
                    This situation can be resolved.

                    At this point it is appropriate to do a careful comparison of the candidate designs.
                    If you are working with a wide-screen monitor,
                    it should be possible to set up a side-by-side comparison.
                    There is an on-line Help entry that describes how this can be done for Help content.
                    You can follow the same browser window configuration to work with two
                    ODOP design sessions at the same time.

                    Aside from using a wide-screen monitor,
                    it is also possible to use your browser's print feature to print each of the candidate designs
                    and lay the printed pages side-by-side on a physical desktop.

                    Your preferred candidate design can be the basis for manufacturing a custom spring.

                    <p>
                    Our last step is to determine if there is an available catalog spring that meets
                    the original design specifications.
                    ODOP:Spring comes equipped with multiple spring catalogs, including:
                    </p>

                    <Table borderless variant="success" size="sm">

                    <p>
                    Similar catalogs are available for extension springs.
                    Currently available spring catalogs use U.S. units.

                    If necessary,
                    use the File : Open... menu to:
                    <br /><br />
                    <b>Re-open the preferred candidate design.</b>

                    <b>Use the Action : Select Catalog... menu</b>
                    <br /><br />
                    to review the four most similar designs in the catalog.
                    The display of catalog entries is ranked by objective function value
                    (OBJ is a measure of constraint violation).
                    Selecting a design from the catalog replaces the current design so that you can evaluate it.
                    As mentioned previously, more detail about standard design catalogs is available in the

                    the side-by-side browser configuration can be used to compare the details of the custom spring

                    You may also open a previously saved design to resume from that point.

                    This concludes this Guided Design section of the tutorial.
                    The mission here has been to introduce the process and best practices associated with using the
                    ODOP:Spring software to design a full custom spring.
                    From there, this tutorial session illustrated how to check built-in catalogs to
                    determine if a stock spring can come close to meeting the application requirements as
                    originally expressed in terms of Fixes and constraints.
                    At this point, you should have a sufficient understanding of the steps involved to
                    continue using the software for other opportunities in spring design.
