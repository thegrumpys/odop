                    The following example provides the ODOP:Spring solution to a reference book
                    problem illustrating the design of a compression spring .
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    While this particular problem statement struggles with ambiguity on
                    details like end type and stress correction factor,
                    it provides a good opportunity to demonstrate how to handle a "design-to-stress"
                    approach that is common in traditional manual calculations.
                    More detail on this point appears later in this session.

                    As with the other tutorial and demo sessions,
                    this session needs to start from a known state.
                    So, if you have entered any work of value that is not yet saved,
                    use the <b>File : Save</b> menu item to save your work before continuing.
                    Moving to the next page will establish the necessary initialState.

                    We will start by skipping the sailboat context and briefly restate the problem.
                    Our challenge is to design a compression spring such that the following
                    specifications are met:<br />
                    <br />
                    material              =  302  stainless<br />
                    maximum force (solid) = 90.0  pounds<br />
                    maximum deflection    =  3.0  inches<br />
                    mean diameter      =  1.0 inch &nbsp; (arbitrary value utilized in handbook solution)<br />
                    design stress (solid) = 80,000 psi &nbsp; (uncorrected)<br />
                    <br />
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Select free length, wire diameter and number of coils
                    for a compression spring to be fitted with drawbars and
                    used in an extension spring application.
                    Compression to solid is probable in this application.
                    </p>
                </>
            )

                    <p>
                    This problem statement is a bit unusual in that it has the design load coincide with the solid condition.
                    Because the problem has specified a specific stress level,
                    we will treat this as a "design-to-stress" problem.
                    You may wish to review the
                    &nbsp;<a href="/docs/Help/SpringDesign/advancedSpringOperations.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Design To Stress</a>&nbsp;
                    and
                    &nbsp;<a href="/docs/Help/SpringDesign/materials.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Materials</a>&nbsp;
                    sections of the documentation (on-line Help entries) for additional information.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Before we start making changes,
                    this is a good time for you to review our starting values.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    At this point we are going to take a side trip into the nitty-gritty
                    of the Wahl stress correction factor.
                    The handbook requests a design that provides a specific uncorrected stress level.
                    ODOP:Spring has the correction factor built in to its calculations.
                    So, we need to determine the necessary correction factor
                    and then use that to manually adjust the target stress value used by ODOP:Spring.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Also, before abandoning the material table,
                    we will take a sneak peek at the value of wire tensile strength
                    associated with the handbook solution.
                    This will provide a bit of context in evaluating the handbook design.

                    The following changes have now been imposed by the demo session:

                    CHANGE Material_Type 302_STAINLESS &nbsp; <br />
                    CHANGE OD_Free 1.142<br />
                    CHANGE Wire_Dia 0.142
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Observe that Report 2 displays a kw1 correction factor of 1.211.
                    Observe that the material table provides a Tensile stress value of 196,938 PSI
                    associated with a wire size of 0.142 inch.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    In the process of moving to the next page,
                    this demo session will select a property calculation method that does not utilize the built-in
                    table of material properties.
                    The values of Density, Torsion Modulus and Tensile for 302 Stainless will carry forward
                    but other properties will be specified separately.
                    Specifically, the stress correction factor adjusted value of allowable stress will be applied.
                    In the process, the previous values of OD_Free and Wire_Dia will be restored so that the demo session
                    is not able to "cheat" and start the solution with the handbook answer already in place.

                    CHANGE Stress_Lim_Stat 96880
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Again, the change to Prop_Calc_Method is the key to our "design-to-stress" approach.
                    It is what allows stress limits to be directly specified and not supplied from the materials table.
                    The value of 96,880 is the problem-specified 80,000 PSI with
                    the previously noted stress correction factor applied.

                    Now that there has been a slight change in wire diameter, another search
                    will be required to make corresponding adjustments in the other parameters.

                    We have a solution. Please take a moment to scroll through and view the values.

                    The original problem statement did not specify an end type.
                    It turns out that selecting a different end type may impact free length
                    but otherwise doesn't impact the final solution.

                    The handbook results:<br />
                    &nbsp; &nbsp;  wire diameter = 0.142 in.<br />
                    &nbsp; &nbsp;  stress at solid = 80,000  psi &nbsp;  (uncorrected)<br />
                    &nbsp; &nbsp;  number of active coils = 16.95 &nbsp; (rounded to 17)
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    The ODOP:Spring solution required an adjustment:<br />
                    &nbsp; &nbsp;  Wahl stress correction factor kw1 = 1.211  psi &nbsp;  (from Report 2)<br />
                    &nbsp; &nbsp;  stress at solid = 96,880  psi &nbsp;  (corrected)
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    With the adjustment in place, the results are in very good agreement.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    While the ambiguity over stress correction factor and end type provided a few
                    challenges in formulating this demonstration session,
                    the real objective of demonstrating how ODOP:Spring can handle a "design-to-stress"
                    problem has been achieved.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Finally, it seems appropriate to comment that the handbook specifies a stress level
                    that seems excessive for stainless steel.
                    Perhaps the handbook problem was originally developed in the context of carbon steel
                    and then later switched to specify stainless to accomodate the background story
                    of a maritime environment.
                    In any case, we should anticipate a short cycle life for this design.
