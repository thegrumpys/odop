                    As with the other tutorial and demo sessions,
                    this session needs to start from a known state.
                    So, if you have entered any work of value that is not yet saved,
                    use the <b>File : Save</b> menu item to save your work before continuing.

                    In spite of the .340 maximum solid height requirement, special
                    mention is made of the fact that the spring is never compressed
                    beyond its "normal" length of .385 inch.

                    <p>
                    As a hint, it is mentioned that a music wire spring of 0.035 inch
                    wire diameter operated satisfactorily.  This fact was used to aid
                    the handbook solution for number of active coils.

                    Taking the hint about the spring never being compressed below its
                    working length of .385 in., we'll permit the factor of safety in the
                    solid condition to drop below 1.00.
