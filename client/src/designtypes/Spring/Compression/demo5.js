                    As a general rule, in the first approach to a new problem,
                    we let the calculations use an arbitrary (non-standard) wire diameter.

                    <p>
                    Now, in order to conclude this problem,
                    we want to demonstrate the ODOP SELECT SIZE feature.
                    Go to the <b>Action : Select Size...</b> menu item
                    and chose the nearest standard wire diameter.
                    In summary:
                    <br /><br />
                    SELECT  Wire_Dia 0.120<br />
                    <br />
                    In any case, to guarantee the expected outcome, the demo session will
                    to use a FIX to impose the expected value of Wire_Dia.
                    Look for the new value of Wire_Dia on the next page.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Now that there has been a slight change in wire diameter, another search
                    will be required to make corresponding adjustments in the other parameters.
                    For this problem, only the number of coils remains to be determined.
