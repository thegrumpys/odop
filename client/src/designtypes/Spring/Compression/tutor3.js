                    In this tutorial session we will continue to develop the idea of
                    using "constraints" and "constraint levels" to express goals
                    for a design.
                    Once we have established a set of goals or objectives that
                    a given design is to achieve, we can use the Search capability
                    to find a design that will (hopefully) achieve those objectives.

                    As with the other tutorial and demo sessions,
                    this session needs to start from a known state.
                    So, if you have entered any work of value that is not yet saved,
                    use the <b>File : Save</b> menu item to save your work before continuing.
                    Moving to the next page will establish the necessary initialState.

                    <p>
                    It's time to take a look at the set of constraint levels.
                    Note that the default set of constraint levels imposed in the initialState
                    are set to allow a broad range of springs to be feasible.
                    More information about the constraints of spring design is provided in the
                    on-line documentation sections (Help entries) titled
                    &nbsp;<a href="/docs/Help/SpringDesign/spring_oview.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spring Design Overview</a>&nbsp;
                    and
                    &nbsp;<a href="/docs/Help/designSituations.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Design Situations</a>.&nbsp;
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Each constraint has a corresponding constraint violation that represents
                    the difference between the current value of the quantity being
                    constrained and the constraint level.  The "Violation"
                    column lists constraint violation as a percentage of the
                    corresponding constraint level.  A negative value implies that the
                    constraint is satisfied.  A positive value implies that the
                    constraint is violated.

                    The "Objective Value" is the thing that the search procedure
                    uses to measure how close a given design is to being feasible.
                    It is formed by adding a contribution from all the violated constraints.
                    Thus, as in this case, if all the constraints are satisfied, the
                    objective value is zero and we have a "strictly feasible" design.<br />
                    <br />
                    Let's find out what a violated constraint looks like.<br />
                    <br />
                    Take a look at the current values of outside diameter in the free condition and
                    its associated constraint.

                    <p>
                    The tutorial has changed a constraint: CHANGE  OD_Free MAX 0.9<br />
                    <br />
                    Take a look at the results.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    It should be pretty hard to miss the violation of OD_FREE MAX.
                    Also, the tool-tip on the "Status" label of the
                    multi-colored Feasibility Status indicator shows that
                    the Objective Value is greater than zero.
                    This is a good clue that there is work for the search procedure to do.<br />
                    <br />
                    Shall we see if Search can find a design with a smaller (less than
                    0.9 inch OD) spring that can still support the designated load ?
                    Note that the tutorial has also put Force_2 in FIXed status so that
                    designated load will not be changed by the search process.

                    for a solution.

                    observe that the OD in the free condition is far enough below .9 inches
                    to guarantee that the OD in the solid condition is also below .9 inches.

                    Now that we have covered the concept of constraints, we can describe
                    the use of FIX on a Dependent Variable in more specific terms.  The FIX
                    of a Dependent Variable is the creation of a two sided constraint that
                    is more heavily weighted than a normal constraint.  Thus when we
                    used FIX to establish a specific deflection in the earlier section
                    of the tutorial, we were actually using the search to solve a two
                    sided constraint problem.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Once that you've made it this far through the tutorial, you know
                    enough to be really dangerous.  Most spring design can be accomplished
                    with the capabilities that have been covered already.  Let's run through
                    one quick example that combines a few FIXes and a few modified
                    constraint levels, then turn you loose for some more practice.

                    <p>
                    For our sample problem let's suppose that we want to design a spring
                    to support a load of 280 pounds at a deflection of 5.5 inches.
                    The spring must operate in a 2.0 inch hole and must not set if compressed
                    to solid.  Considering that we haven't yet covered changing material
                    and end types, we'll use the currently established MUSIC_WIRE and
                    CLOSED&GROUND ends.

                    CHANGE  OD_Free MAX  2.0<br />

                    While it normally doesn't make much difference where we start a search,
                    applying a 280 pound load to a spring that was designed to support a
                    40 pound load will (mathematically) drive that spring far below its
                    solid condition.
                    The search process will generally cope with such a poor starting point,
                    but in some cases,
                    you can avoid a bit of difficulty by
                    entering  values that produce a more realistic start point.

                    conditions in the initialState starting point.

                    <p>
                    This time, let's see if we can handle a design that has both force and
                    length specified at each of two points.
                    As long as L_Free (spring length in the free, no load condition) is in FREE status,
                    this should not be a problem.
                    You may want to review

                    to better understand the limitations of specifying force and deflection at two points.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Suppose we want a spring that delivers 15 pounds force at a length
                    of 2 inches, and 65 pounds force at a length of 1.25 inches.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Again, the tutorial has already imposed the changes ...<br />
                    FIX  Force_1  15<br />
                    FIX  L_1       2<br />
                    FIX  Force_2  65<br />
                    FIX  L_2    1.25<br />

                    This section of the tutorial has covered a lot of important ground.
                    We have seen how constraints can express one sided goals for the
                    design.  By manipulating the constraint levels
                    and establishing target values for the Dependent Variables with FIX,
                    we set up a design problem to solve with Search.
                    By selecting different combinations of constraints and FIXes, we can express
                    a great variety of different spring design problems.  Take a few minutes
                    before starting the next section of the tutorial to try a few.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    The next section of the tutorial will cover the techniques necessary
                    to Save or print the information about a design.
                    Once saved, this information can be picked up for further work in a later session.

                    After that, another section of the tutorial will introduce the
                    techniques for selecting spring wire materials (with their associated
                    allowable stresses) and selecting spring end types.
