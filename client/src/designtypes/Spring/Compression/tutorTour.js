                    This tutorial session provides a quick tour of the ODOP "main" page
                    also known as the "Advanced View".
                    This session is independent of the spring type (compression, extension or torsion)
                    and does not make any changes to the existing design.

                    <p>
                    To continue with this session, just click the "Next" button as you finish
                    reading each page (step).

                    snippets of the main page and then provide a description of how each
                    section contributes the the operation of the program.

                    Scroll down to see the remainder of the page.
                    The app remains fully functional.
                    You can follow instructions provided in the tutorial sessions
                    and the app will respond.

                    ODOP contains an "on-line" help facility.
                    It includes an overview of the program, a generic
                    &nbsp;<a href="/docs/Help/gettingStarted.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Getting Started</a>&nbsp;
                    section, a

                    section plus helpful hints and detailed explanations of major features.

                    <p>
                     But first, a few words about what <b>not</b> to expect ...
                    The on-line help facility is not intended to replace the documentation that comes
                    with your browser or computer system.
                    Also, the Help facility is not intended to teach spring design.
                    The spring design user is expected to know the
                    basic physics of springs and strength of materials.
                    The spring design content assumes that the user is familiar with the
                    concepts of stress, factor of safety, yield point, endurance limit, etc.

                    Constraints are single sided (Max or Min) limits imposed on the
                    selected Variable.
                    First, mark the constraint checkbox and then enter a value in the entry field.
                    The amount of constraint violation will be recalculated immediately;
                    a positive value if violated or a negative value if satisfied.
                    The Objective Value will reflect the aggregate impact of all violated constraints.
                    This example illustrates a few of the constraints provided with

                    Enter the FIX value into either entry field.

                    This tutorial session will now wrap up with a few bits of
                    general information.

                    Since you may not be familiar with the names of ODOP:Spring variables,
                    the next screen will illustrate several variable names in the

                    Remember that it is always possible to restart a given session of
                    the ODOP demo / tutorial.
                    If at any point you become curious about
                    "Why does the tutorial do it that way ?",
                    you can finish that tutorial section normally,
                    then return to the point in question later.
                    Alternatively, it is possible to make a sequence of changes in mid-tutorial
                    to explore your ideas and then use the "Back" button to get back on
                    track with the tutorial.
                    You are encouraged to experiment with the program.
                    You are not likely to break it or wear it out !
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    More tutorial sessions are available.
                    They have names like tutor3, tutor4, ... etc.
                    Refer to the on-line documentation section (Help entry) covering the
                    &nbsp;<a href="/docs/Help/tutordemo.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tutorial and Demo</a>&nbsp;
                    for a list of topics.
                    </p>

                    <p>If you do not wish to continue with more tutorial sessions or demonstration problems,
                    you can experiment with the various ODOP features, menus and reports.
                    The HELP menu is a good place to start. </p>
