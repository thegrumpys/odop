                    As with the other tutorial and demo sessions,
                    this session needs to start from a known state.
                    So, if you have entered any work of value that is not yet saved,
                    use the <b>File : Save</b> menu item to save your work before continuing.
                    Moving to the next page will establish the necessary initialState.

                    Before we make any changes, let's review a problem statement that
                    is similar to a sample compression spring problem
                    contained in the design handbook of a large spring manufacturer.

                Note the warning message.  It says that when applying a 112
                pound force, the current values of WIRE_DIA, COILS_T and L_FREE
                (remaining as established by the initialState) create a starting
                point where L_2, the length at point 2, is less than the solid length
                (less than zero, actually).
                This is an impossible condition and provides a difficult start point for the search.
                However in this case, we'll ignore the message and proceed with the search.

                    <p>
                    Clearly, there is more than one possible solution to this problem, as stated.
                    We established a constraint on outside diameter,
                    thus permitting any value less than this maximum value.
                    ODOP:Spring seems to
                    have discovered a solution with a significantly smaller outside diameter
                    than the one derived in the handbook (1.5 in.), yet it meets all the
                    other problem specifications.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    The handbook selected the design's outside diameter based on 95 % of the hole diameter.
                    This could be significant if buckling is an issue.
                    A larger outside diameter will be less prone to buckling.
                    Also, a correct fit within the hole will provide lateral support for the spring
                    and thus reduce any tendency to buckle.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Before going further, be sure to look at the wire size, number of coils,
                    stress at solid, factor of safety and weight of
                    the design produced by ODOP:Spring.

                    While the ODOP:Spring solution and the handbook solution are quite different,
                    the ODOP:Spring analysis of the handbook design
                    is very close to the results predicted by the handbook.

                    As you can see by the violation of the upper constraint on the
                    factor of safety at Point 2 (FS_2),
                    ODOP:Spring is not entirely happy with the handbook design because it is
                    very conservative (low stress).
                    The ODOP compression spring initialState contains an upper
                    constraint on factor of safety at point 2 (FS_2 MAX = 1.5) that causes
                    the program to seek designs that are not excessively conservative.
                    Remember that this constraint is easily adjusted simply by changing the
                    value in that constraint field.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    As can be expected, there is a weight penalty for a more conservative design.
                    The ODOP:Spring design had a smaller factor of safety and less weight.
