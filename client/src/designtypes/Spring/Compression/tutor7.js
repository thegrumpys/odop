                    ODOP Seek provides a powerful facility for asking "What if ... " and "What's best ?" kinds of questions.
                    In order to do this, Seek utilizes the concepts of mathematical optimization.
                    Specifically, the program can probe the constrained extreme of any variable, independent or dependent.
                    For example, within the context of coil spring design ODOP:Spring can be asked to find the lightest material weight
                    (or lowest spring rate, least solid height, greatest factor of safety, greatest cycle life, greatest energy storage, etc.)
                    all while maintaining specified objectives for force-deflection characteristics, stress, diameters, etc.
                    It is this "goal seeking" capability that makes ODOP:Spring much more than a spring calculator.

                    This section of the tutorial will set up a few different compression spring problems,
                    each with a reasonably large feasible region, and then use the
                    ODOP Seek feature (<b>Action : Seek</b> menu) to probe the limits in various directions.

                    As with the other tutorial and demo sessions,
                    this session needs to start from a known state.
                    So, if you have entered any work of value that is not yet saved,
                    use the <b>File : Save</b> menu item to save your work before continuing.
                    Moving to the next page will establish the necessary initialState
                    for the ODOP Compression Spring design type.

                    The initial conditions expected by this tutorial session are now established.

                    <p>
                    First, a few words on the subject of optimization ...
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Visualize for a moment the consequences of specifying only a minimum load ...
                    say 20 pounds ...  that a spring should support and then asking ODOP:Spring to
                    design a spring of minimum weight without supplying any additional constraints.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    If we just turn the software loose, we are asking for a spring with the least
                    amount of metal that could still support 20 pounds of force.  However, given
                    no additional constraints, the process is likely to produce some pretty
                    bizarre results.
                    For example, without a constraint on inside diameter,
                    the coil outside diameter could be reduced (mathematically, if not physically)
                    to twice the wire diameter or perhaps even less.
                    Without a constraint on Rate or
                    Stroke (change in length between point 1 and point 2),
                    the number of coils could be reduced to something less than one
                    and free length reduced down to equal the solid height.
                    The result is the mathematical equivalent of a solid bar supporting
                    the 20 pound load.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                     Well, at least it has the minimum weight that we asked for !
                     </p>

                     <p>
                    When asking to optimize a design, you must understand that the search process will
                    find such trivial (also called "degenerate") cases.  It is necessary to
                    impose realistic constraints and when the process does something unexpected,
                    make appropriate changes to constraints and run through the calculation process again.

                    One more point ... <br />
                    When Search terminates with a strictly feasible solution (i.e. Objective Value = 0.0),
                    the resulting solution point is likely only one of many possible solution points.
                    The entire collection of feasible solution points bounded by the various constraints
                    is referred to as a "feasible region".
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    The ODOP Search feature will terminate when it finds its first feasible solution.
                    The Seek solution process is easier if it has a feasible design as its starting point.
                    At a minimum, it should be understood that a feasible design is available.
                    In the case that a Search has terminated without finding a feasible point,
                    use of the

                    We start by adding a few constraints to the compression spring starting point used in other tutorial sessions.

                    If you see the Feasibility status shown as "NOT FEASIBLE",
                    It means that the solution point has slightly violated constraints
                    in order to achieve improvements in the result
                    (minimum Weight in this case).

                    This can happen when the optimum is far from the starting point.
                    As a result, the internal estimate of the optimum was not perfect.
                    Simply re-execute Seek to refine the result.

                    Let's try exploring in a different direction.
                    Perhaps this will be a design that prioritizes a softer spring
                    with a reduced spring rate.
                    Take note of the current value of Rate.

                    In general, it is the interaction of more than one constraint that
                    limits further progress in achieving even better results.
                    In this case the constraints on solid height (L_Solid) and
                    factor of safety in the solid condition (FS_Solid)
                    prevent further progress in reducing the spring rate.
                    If you are looking for a spring with a good cycle life
                    or no tendency to buckle under load,
                    additional constraints will be necessary.

                    <p>
                    Let's see what happens if we ask for a spring with the lowest possible solid height
                    consistent with our objectives for OD, Stroke, and load capacity.

                    support a 100 pound static load at a minimum of 2.5 inches
                    deflection.  Just to make the problem a little bit more interesting,
                    we'll ignore the material and simply say that we want no more than 80,000

                    Changing FS_2 MIN to be 1.0 causes the value of Stress_Lim_Stat
                    (80,000 PSI) to apply at point 2.
                    There will be no additional margin in the factor of safety.

                    As mentioned previously, while it is not always absolutely necessary,
                    it is best practice to start the optimization process from or near a feasible start point.
                    At the very least, you want to know that a feasible solution is available.

                    Yes, a feasible solution is available.
                    You should scan through the details.

                    The search stops with the first feasible design it finds.  It is not
                    necessarily a design that delivers 80,000 PSI stress at point 2.
                    However, when we ask for a minimum weight design (that is also a
                    feasible design), we can expect the process to take up the slack
                    and achieve the desired 80,000 psi stress at
                    point 2 (100 pound load).

                    Optionally, you can use the <b>File : Properties</b> menu
                    to mark this design with a comment like:
                    "This is the point where we start optimizing" and
                    use <b>File : Save As</b> to save it into the Design Library

                    Before going further, look at the current value of weight.
                    We expect that the ultimate answer will be less than that.
                    After all, that's what optimization is all about.

                    We have a solution.
                    It is typical for Seek to produce a solution that "bends" the constraints
                    just a bit.
                    The underlying math is balancing the penalty of violating the constraints
                    with the reward of an improved value of the target variable.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Note that we achieved something very close to the desired 80,000 PSI at point 2.

                    If you previously saved the starting point (tutor7StartPoint) into the Design Library,
                    you can now set up a second design session in another browser window,
                    retrieve that optimization starting point and then arrange a side-by-side
                    comparison between the current design and the one that that existed before
                    minimizing weight.

                    Next we'll use the Seek feature to find a design that supports the

                    solid height.

                    Even after the changes, this design is feasible.

                    To summarize,
                    the ODOP:Spring Seek feature (<b>Action : Seek</b> menu)
                    provides the ability to maximize or minimize
                    any single variable (Independent or Dependent)
                    subject to the existing constraints on the problem.
                    In other words, Seek does constrained optimization.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    In spring design, a common
                    requirement is to find the spring of least weight that satisfies a
                    specific set of requirements.
                    In other situations, the designer may need to determine
                    the greatest load, greatest factor of safety, lowest spring rate,
                    greatest cycle life or greatest energy storage that
                    may be produced within the space constraints of the application.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Seek is the right tool for that job.

                    The next tutorial section looks at the ODOP Trade feature.  In many
                    ways Trade is a mirror image capability to that of Seek.
                    When a design problem is expressed in terms of constraints and first
                    submitted to the search, the feasibility of the design will be
                    determined.  If the result is feasible, Seek may be used to
                    probe the limits of the feasible region.
                    However if the result is not feasible by a significant margin,
                    Trade may be used to identify those constraints that are most
                    leveraged and thus guide the designer to restructure his goals in a way that
                    is most consistent with the performance that can be achieved within the
                    limits of available space and material properties.
