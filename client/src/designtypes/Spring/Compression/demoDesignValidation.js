                    The following example illustrates the use of ODOP:Spring to validate
                    the design of a compression spring.
                    Also known as "design check", this is a straightforward calculation of
                    stresses and other figures of merit for a design with known
                    wire diameter, coil diameter, number of coils, free length and
                    applied loads or deflections.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    As described in the tutorial session named tutorTour,
                    this light green panel is inserted above the main page.
                    The ODOP:Spring app is just displaced downward.
                    It remains fully functional.

                    <p>
                    As with the other tutorial and demo sessions,
                    this session needs to start from a known state.
                    So, if you have entered any work of value that is not yet saved,
                    use the <b>File : Save</b> menu item to save your work before continuing.
                    Moving to the next page will establish the necessary initialState
                    for the ODOP <b>Compression Spring</b> design type.

                    reading each page (step).

                    The initial conditions expected by this demo session are now established.
                    Before we make additional changes, let's review the problem statement:<br />
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Estimate the life of a compression spring of the specified dimensions
                    when subjected to the given working lengths; determine corresponding forces,
                    stress levels, tendency to buckle, and other figures of merit for the design.
                    </p>

                    In general, the easiest way to begin is to modify an existing design.
                    This demo session will modify this design until it meets the requirements of the current design problem.
                    The following sequence of pages will illustrate this process.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Since you may not be familiar with the names of ODOP:Spring variables,
                    the next screen will illustrate several variable names in the
                    context of a force-deflection diagram.

                    <p>Next, we enter everything we know about the problem. </p>

                    <p>Because this session is simply checking the performance of an existing design,
                    we will primarily use the ODOP capability to FIX the value of selected Independent
                    and Dependent variables.
                    Other demo and tutorial sessions
                    that illustrate the use of ODOP:Spring in an original design situation
                    will introduce additional capabilities of the software.</p>

                    <p>This is a good time to take a good look at the existing values.
                    Many values will update immediately as the demo session enters the changes.</p>

                    Now that we have expressed what we want the design to accomplish,
                    we will ask "Search" for a solution.
                    Specifically, to solve for the Force_1 and Force_2
                    values that correspond to the FIXes that have just been established.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    If the Search process can find a solution that fully satisfies all the constraints,
                    it will display "<b>STRICTLY FEASIBLE</b>" in the Result section (immediately below these words).
                    If a satisfactory solution is found, but one or more constraints remain violated by a
                    trivial amount, the program will display "<b>FEASIBLE</b>" in the Result section.
