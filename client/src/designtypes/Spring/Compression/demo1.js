                        The following example illustrates the use of ODOP:Spring in
                        the design of a compression spring.

                        As with the other tutorial and demo sessions,
                        this session needs to start from a known state.
                        So, if you have entered any work of value that is not yet saved,
                        use the <b>File : Save</b> menu item to save your work before continuing.
                        Moving to the next page will establish the necessary initialState.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        To continue with this example, just click the "Next" button as you finish
                        reading each page (step).

                    In general, the easiest way to begin is to modify an existing design.
                    This demo session will modify this design until it meets the requirements
                    of the current design problem.
                    The following sequence will illustrate this process.

                    Before making any additional changes,
                    Example 1 may be restated: &nbsp; Design a compression spring such that<br />
                    <br />
                    outside diameter =  0.925 in.<br />

                    solid height    &lt;=  1.060 in.<br />
                    material         =  oil tempered wire<br />

                    <p>This is a good time to take a good look at the existing values.

                    We can be sure that a search is necessary.  It's quite unlikely that
                    the starting values would have produced the desired combination of
                    force and deflection at point 2.

                    <p>
                    But first, we have made a small change that will allow ODOP:Spring to
                    consider designs with a larger than normal factor of safety.
                    Specifically, <br />

                    The handbook solution did a bit of hand waving and used  0.125 inch
                    for wire diameter.
                    Let's see what ODOP:Spring says is a standard size for wire diameter ...

                    Please confirm that Wire_Dia is FIXed at 0.125 inch.
                    We will need to Search one more time to bring all the numbers into alignment.

                    <p>
                    The difference in force at solid and stress at solid is attributable
                    to the fact that the handbook analysis made an initial assumption
                    of solid height equal to 1.06 inches, then later failed to adjust
                    the assumption to correspond to the actual 1.00 inch solid height.

                    <p>
                    Compare the Handbook solution (above) to the values produced by ODOP:Spring (below and Reports).

                    <p>
                    We can quickly confirm this notion by setting FORCE_2 to the handbook's value.
                    Basically,
                    <br /><br />
                    CHANGE  Force_2  75.1
                    <br /><br />
                    So, now that the new value for Force_2 is in place,
                    the value of STRESS_2 is a reasonable match for the corresponding
                    stress value in the handbook example.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    We can wrap up by saying that the ODOP:Spring values are a good match
                    for the handbook solution.
