                    This demo session works through a handbook design example and confirms that the
                    results are in reasonable agreement with results published in the handbook.

                    Considering that the objective here is to illustrate how ODOP:Spring produces the same results as the handbook,
                    it will be necessary to use the same value of Modulus of Elasticity (E).
                    The ODOP:Spring materials table provides a value for E of 30,000,000 psi.
                    </p>

                    For MUSIC_WIRE of 0.063 inch diameter:

                            <li>The handbook's method 1 (page 212) uses a value for E of 29,000,000 psi from Fig. 134 (page 214).</li>
                            <li>The handbook's method 2 (page 213) uses a value for E of 28,700,000 psi from Fig. 112 (page 161).</li>

                    As described in the on-line Help section on

                    and also in the compression spring tutorial sessions tutor5 and tutor7,
                    changing Prop_Calc_Method will allow the use of different material property values.

                    The demo session has now entered the remaining initial specifications for the problem.
                    In summary, the changes were:<br />
                    <br />
                    FIX   M_1  0.0<br />
                    FIX   M_2  4.0<br />
                    FIX   ID_Free  0.75<br />
                    FIX   Deflect_2  200.0<br />
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    This is a good time to scroll down and confirm these changes are now in place.

                    <p>
                    A search will bring the remaining variables into alignment with these initial specifications.
                    Coil diameter is the primary element impacted here.

                    Don't forget to review the Report(s).

                    <p>
                    As expected, the design has achieved or come very close to the previously stated requirements for
                    ID_Free, M_2 and Deflect_2.
                    The (uncorrected) value of stress is a good match to the handbook's value of 162,800 psi.
                    In order to achieve the specified deflection,
                    the value of Coils_T is slightly higher than the handbook's value of 7.04 coils.
                    Thus, the value of L_Body is also a bit higher than the handbook's value of 0.504 inch.

                    The handbook solution used a standard wire diameter.
                    The <b>Action : Select Size</b> menu item can be used to select the nearest standard wire diameter.
                    You can experiment with that now.

                    <p>
                     The handbook recommended a Coil_Spacing of 0.015 inch per coil.
                    Also, the handbook determined a curvature correction factor of 1.06 by reading it from a graph.

                    In the process of transitioning to the next page, the demo session will
                    FIX a value of 0.063 inch on Wire_Dia,
                    adjust the value of Coil_Spacing,
                    change Heat_Treat to "Stress Relieve" in order to utilize a curvature correction factor
                    and then
                    run another search to re-establish corresponding values for the two remaining free Independent Variables.

                    and executed another search.

                    <p>
                    The handbook solution produced:<br />
                         &nbsp; wire diameter  =  0.063 in.<br />
                         &nbsp; total coils    =  7.04   coils<br />
                         &nbsp; deflected inside diameter   = 0.6948 in.<br />
