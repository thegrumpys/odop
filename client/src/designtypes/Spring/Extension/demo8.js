                    the design of an extension spring.

                    this session needs to start from a known state.

                    Our next problem is similar to a sample extension spring problem
                    contained in the design handbook of a large spring manufacturer.

                    We begin by entering the problem as specified.
                    At first glance, it appears that there is nothing particularly
                    problematic about these specifications.
                    The problem does not appear to be overspecified.

                    For now, we'll let the solution process select any value of End_Extension that

                    While ODOP:Spring is able to find a solution that satisfies the design
                    criteria, it is a bit different from the handbook solution.
                    The remainder of this demo session will look at the differences.

                    Before further examination of the details, the demo session will select the
                    standard wire size that is the next size larger than the current
                    (non-standard) value determined by this search.
                    Depending on the size of the change, another search is usually
                    required to adjust for the different wire diameter.

                    <p>
                    The <b>Action : Select Size</b> menu item can be used to select the nearest standard wire diameter.
                    You can experiment with that now.

                    FIX a value of 0.035 inch on Wire_Dia and then
                    run another search to re-establish corresponding values for all the other problem variables.

                    Now that we have demonstrated that the ODOP:Spring software can produce
                    an acceptable design,
                    the demo session will enter the handbook results in order to
                    provide a validation of the the software's internal calculations.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    The handbook does its calculations in metric units, later converting to
                    equivalent English units.
                    The 0.9 mm wire diameter is approximated as an 0.035 inch English size.
                    The comparison works better if we tell ODOP:Spring the exact decimal inch
                    equivalent of 0.9 mm.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Using the ODOP:Spring definition of End_Extension,
                    the handbook solution uses a zero end extension.

                    <p>
                    ODOP:Spring normally makes an allowance for deflection in the hooks.
                    The handbook calculation did not make any such allowance.
                    Our comparison will be closer if set the ODOP:Spring allowance to zero.
                    Because the hook deflection allowance is determined from a table based
                    on end type, it will be necessary to "switch off" this table look up
                    process first.
                    That is accomplished by selecting the "User_Specified" end type.
