                    As with the other tutorial and demo sessions,
                    this session needs to start from a known state.
                    So, if you have entered any work of value that is not yet saved,
                    use the <b>File : Save</b> menu item to save your work before continuing.

                    Carlson's Figure 128 indicates that the length added by the hook at each
                    end should be 75-85 % of a body inside diameter.
                    So, we'll select an End_Type of 75%_Hook to start.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    The change will be applied in the process of transitioning to the next page.

                    new preference values have been imposed to illustrate how it is done in a Demo session.
                    Look at the <b>File : Preferences</b> menu to see the details.
                    The values are the same as provided by running the <b>Action : Execute : increasePrecision</b>
                    &nbsp; menu item.

                    Now let's see what the search has achieved.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Yes, the program agrees that a feasible solution is available.
                    But before we get involved with the details,
                    since the handbook selected a standard wire diameter (0.0625),
                    we should do the same.
                    Then we need to repeat the search to adjust the other parameters.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    The <b>Action : Select Size</b> menu item can be used to select the nearest standard wire diameter.
                    You can experiment with that now.

                    <p>
                    In the process of transitioning to the next page, the demo session will
                    FIX a value of 0.062 inch on Wire_Dia and then
                    run another search to re-establish corresponding values for all the other problem variables.

                    The handbook solution produced:<br />

                        Stress at 2   &nbsp; &nbsp; 82200 psi (torsion) &nbsp; Hook stress &nbsp; 156800 &nbsp;psi (bending)<br />

                    The two solutions are in reasonable agreement.

                    ODOP:Spring's calculation of deflection in the loops (Hook_Deflect_All) will be disabled.
                    Also, in order to use Carlson's 11,200,000 psi value for Torsion Modulus (G),
                    the Calculation Input Prop_Calc_Method will be changed to allow material properties that are
                    not determined by ODOP:Spring's built-in materials table.
