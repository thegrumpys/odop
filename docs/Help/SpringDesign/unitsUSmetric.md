#### Units: US customary and metric 

ODOP:Spring supports both [US customary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_customary_units) (inch, pound) units 
and [metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_system) (mm, Newton) units.
Standard wire diameter size tables are available (and used automatically) for both unit systems.

In order to create spring designs with a specific unit system, it is necessary to open 
 (**File : Open** menu item) a design entry that has been pre-configured for that unit system.

Each ODOP design type will always have a system provided default design starting point (named "Startup") available.
The Startup design for each spring design type (compression, extension & torsion) utilizes US customary (inch, pound) units.
In order to create a design utilizing metric units, simply open the "Startup_Metric" entry.   

It is possibile to personalize the default Startup design. 
See: [Default Designs](../defaultDesigns.html) for more information.
