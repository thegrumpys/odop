#### Tutorial and Demo

The ODOP tutorial / demo feature is intended to to help new users 
get started quickly.
Specially constructed tutorial and demonstration "sessions" provide multiple steps, 
where each step consists of a few paragraphs of text or embedded image positioned
above the normal ODOP main page.
The sessions provide input values and control of ODOP solution functions 
such that the software operates as though it was responding to user input.
Thus, the user can step through the annotated design sessions at a desired pace 
simply by reading and clicking the "Next" button.
While not technically a record / playback situation, the tutorial and demo
feature can be thought of as playing back pre-recorded design sessions.
In fact, the underlying software is always "live" and will respond to user input
in addition to responding to input from the tutorial / demo session.

A "Back" button is provided so that the user can step to previous pages in order 
to re-read or refer to something that may have been missed on the first pass.

Tutorial sessions teach operation of the program.
Use the <b>Help : Tutorial...</b> menu item to select the desired tutorial session.

Demo sessions illustrate problem solving techniques as well as provide
sample solutions to several generally available reference book problems.
Use the <b>Help : Demo...</b> menu item to select the desired demo session.

The tutorial and demo sessions need to start from a known state.
So, if you have entered any work of value that is not yet saved,
use the <b>File : Save</b> or <b>File : Save As</b>
menu item to save your work before starting a session.

tutor5 |   | Calculation Inputs, material properties, allowable stresses, end types  
tutor6 |   | Standard size table, catalog look-up  
tutor7 |   | Seek, minimize spring material; optimization concept, exploration of available solutions  
tutor8 |   | Trade, restructuring goals to find feasible solution  
tutor9 |   | Preferences (internal variables) and Properties (notes saved with design)  

 &nbsp; 

 A sequence of solved demonstration problems is available (or planned) 
 under the names demo through demo(n). 
 Many of the demo sessions contain sample solutions to selected 
 reference book problems where the ODOP:Spring results are compared to 
 the reference book results in order to validate results from the program.  
 
 Demonstration examples available (* or planned) include:
