## Idea for simple showcase problems

In the interest of providing simple demonstration problems that even non-technical users can relate to, 
classic geometric solids might provide a good starting point.
Perhaps most interesting is the rectangular box 
(a.k.a. brick, cuboid, rectangular cuboid, right cuboid, rectangular hexahedron, right rectangular prism, or rectangular parallelepiped).

Design parameters would be:
* Length
* Width
* Height

State Variables might be:
* Volume
* Surface Area
* Girth
* Length+Girth
* Diagonal
* Weight


For parcels, per USPS:
Length is the measurement of the longest dimension and 
girth is the distance around the thickest part (perpendicular to the length). 
Except for USPS Retail Ground and Parcel Select, no mailpiece may measure more than 108 inches in length and girth combined.

Computing the weight of a rectangular box will require the "calculation input" (previously known as a "constant") of density.
This provides an opportunity to develop the kind of user-friendly material selection feature that is considered desirable for the spring design problem.
The user can be offered selections like:
* Hydrogen (at standard temperature & pressure)
* Helium (at standard temperature & pressure)
* Air (at standard temperature & pressure)
* Water
* Gasoline
* Aluminum
* Copper
* Steel
* Lead
* Gold
* Kryptonite  (Density (g cm-3) 0.003425  )

where the density value associated with the user selected material will be used as the calculation input.

Optionally, a second calculation input can be used to convert the density values to other unit systems.

Given success with the rectangular box problem, there may be interest in other solid shapes.
For example, cylinder, sphere and wire.
The wire case can be used as a step towards spring design materials tables.
