## Investigate alternatives to assist implementation of the Execute, Demo and Tutorial features

The Execute feature is the basis of demo and tutorial sessions in the CLI software.
The CLI EXECUTE command has provisions for:
 - user control of  pacing
 - comments that add descriptive annotations around the command being interpreted.

Audio support in order to create voice-over tutorials is desirable, but not required.

Other possibilities include YouTube videos and open source and commercial software.
