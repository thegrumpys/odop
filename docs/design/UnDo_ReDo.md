## Consider an UnDo / ReDo / TimeTravel feature

Is there any real value in implementing an UnDo / ReDo feature ?   

How would it work ? 
Would it utilize the Redux "immutable state" capabilities ?

Note:  The "Back" button of the demo / tutorial feature restores a previously captured state.
The entire state is captured / restored to / from the "Step".
