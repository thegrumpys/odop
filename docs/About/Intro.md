## Introducing ODOP

The **O**pen **D**esign **O**ptimization **P**latform software 
is a web software application (web app) that
provides features and capabilities to facilitate the analysis 
and design of a broad range of problems that have a mathematical model available. 
The software contains a problem independent component, the solution "platform" 
on which multiple problem-specific components (referred to as "design types") 
may be constructed. 

The Rectangular Solid design type is provided as an easy to understand demonstration
of basic capabilities.
The discussion in "ODOP Introduction" (link provided below) starts with basic concepts 
and then leads to a less technical Getting Started explanation based on the 
Rectangular Solid.

**ODOP:Spring** is a full-featured app enabling the engineering design 
of helical coil springs.
While certainly capable of analyzing the performance of an existing spring design,
ODOP:Spring is at its best when used to develop solutions to difficult and 
highly constrained original design problems.

The discussion in "Spring design tutorial and demo" (link provided below) provides instructions
on how to launch the demo and tutorial sessions using the compression spring design type.
The spring design tutorial session named **tutorTour** is a good starting point for those
interested in the shortest possible path to designing springs.

[Launching the program](../Help/launchODOP.html) provides instructions on starting the program,
selecting the appropriate design type and how to arrange browser windows for the best
possible presentation.
