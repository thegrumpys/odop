**Message-of-the-day** &nbsp; updated November 16, 2025  

### Self-hosted Operation
This release contains new features and improved documentation to support "self-hosted" operation of the ODOP app. 

### Authentication transition 
Earlier this year, we transitioned authentication for the ODOP 
[Design Library](http://odop.springdesignsoftware.org/docs/Help/terminology.html#designLib) 
from Okta, a third-party authentication provider, to a new locally developed authentication and login system.  
#### For New Users 
An [ODOP account](http://odop.springdesignsoftware.org/docs/About/userAccounts.html) is not required to design springs. 
An account is required only if saving designs into the Design Library. 
To get an ODOP account:  
• Click the **Sign In** button  (at the left of the menu bar)  
• Follow the **Sign Up** link to create your account  
You will receive a confirmation email message containing a link that completes the sign up process.  
#### For Users With an Existing ODOP Account
When you log in for the first time under this new system, you will be prompted to reset your password. 
The process is quick, secure, and guided every step of the way. 
You can even re-enter your current password if you’d like.  
#### Need Assistance? 
We know changes to authentication can be confusing. If you have any questions or prefer to speak with us directly, 
please [Contact Us](http://odop.springdesignsoftware.org/docs/About/ContactUs.html).  

Thank you for using the **O**pen **D**esign **O**ptimization **P**latform software and the ODOP:Spring app. 
We appreciate your continued feedback and support.
